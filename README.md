# pycrypt

Automate trading crypto using Python to pull data from Binance's API and analyse trends. May or may not consistently lose money but oh well it's fun to play with, and is still more profitable than my trades :)

## Use

-

## Installation

### Dependancies

- Python 3.9+
- Pandas 1.3.3+
- python-binance 1.0.9+
- python-dotenv

## Disclaimer

If you for whatever reason decide to try this out, bear in mind that trading cryptocurrency, specifically automated trading, carries huge risk and you may well lose all of your investment. The Binance API wrapper for Python is not official and I have not tested this to be secure, please use a burner account to be safe.
